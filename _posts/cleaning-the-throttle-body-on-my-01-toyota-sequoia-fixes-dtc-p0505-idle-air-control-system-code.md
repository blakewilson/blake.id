My 2001 Toyota Sequoia recently threw a P0505: Idle Air Control System DTC.

I was able to quickly and easily fix this by cleaning the throttle body. This guide will detail how I did it on my Sequoia but in theory this could work for any other vehicle experiencing the same code.

First, you'll want to take the "V8 4.7L" guard plate off first. You can do this by removing the two 10mm nuts:

Then, remove the 10mm nut securing the hose line to the air intake:

Now, move the hose line out of the way and remove the guard plate:

Next, loosen the hose clamp to the air intake filter box. This can be done with a Philips head or a 10mm socket:

Lastly, loosen the hose clamp attaching the air intake to the throttle body:

With these steps complete, you can pull the air intake **away** from the throttle body intake to expose the throttle body. You can rest the exposed air intake above the throttle body. **Do not have your keys in the ignition or turn on the vehicle from this step forward.**

You can clearly see all the carbon buildup around the butterfly mechanism of the throttle body.

To clean the throttle body, I'm using some [Carb and Choke Cleaner I picked up at O'Reillys.](https://www.oreillyauto.com/detail/c/o-reilly-chemicals/oil--chemicals---fluids/maintenance-chemicals/cleaners---solvents/carburetor-cleaner/4a5b19b886f5/o-reilly-chemicals-12-5-ounce-carburetor-and-choke-cleaner/orc2/72414/v/a/8206/automotive-suv-2001-toyota-sequoia?pos=0)

You'll want to get a clean rag (microfiber preferably) and apply this throttle body cleaner. You want to clean the inner walls of the throttle body, as well as the points in which the butterfly mechanism sits closed.

**Be very careful with opening the throttle body butterfly mechanism manually.**

Some vehicles have an actual line that runs from the accelerator pedal to the throttle body, so when you put your foot on the pedal, the butterfly mechanism opens up.

Other vehicles are electronic and a motor opens the butterfly mechanism. If your car has a motor to open the butterfly mechanism, do so slowly with your finger, vs forcing it open quickly as this will generate electricity within the motor, which is not good.

This video gives a great demonstration on the speed at which you should manually open your throttle body's butterfly mechanism:

As you open the butterfly mechanism manually and slowly with your fingers, stick the rag inside and clean the points at which the butterfly mechanism typically sits closed. Make sure to clean the top and bottom!

here's what she looks like after the cleaning:

Once you are satisfied with the clean, reverse the steps that you took to take things apart.

Be sure to check for any hose lines that may have become loose in the cleaning process.

Once everything is back together, clear the trouble codes and fire her up! you should see the P0505 trouble code go away.
