Today, I launched Google Maps Directions Link Generator, a small web app that will generate you a "get directions" link to your company in Google Maps. I found that Google provides no simple way to get a link like this, so I decided to whip up this simple web app!

It's pretty simple and to the point. Just enter your business address/desired location, and a link will be generated for you to use on your website so customers can easily get directions to your business.
