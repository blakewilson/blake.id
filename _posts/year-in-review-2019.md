2019 was a great year. It was filled with a lot of learning, new endeavours, and good times. Here is a small recap of some of the accomplishments and notable events that came up throughout the year in chronological order.

### 2018-2019 Ski Season

Throughout the 2018-2019 snow season, I snowboarded 165,000 vertical feet at [Northstar Tahoe](https://www.northstarcalifornia.com/) and [Heavenly Tahoe](https://www.skiheavenly.com/) thanks to my [Epic Pass](https://www.epicpass.com/).

This Year, I bought an [Ikon Pass](https://www.ikonpass.com/), and will be hitting [Squaw Valley](https://squawalpine.com/), [Mammoth](https://www.mammothmountain.com/), and hopefully [Jackson Hole](https://www.jacksonhole.com/).

### Launched My Blog

I finally got around to launching my blog (this site). I have gotten into the habit of documenting new projects and professional accomplishments. It helps to look back and see what has been done, and what I can improve on.

### Released vidbg.js 2

I completely revamped [vidbg.js](https://github.com/blakewilson/vidbg) and released version 2. This is a complete overhaul from the ground up using ES6+ JavaScript, ditching the jQuery dependency. It also supports mobile playback, amongst other new features. Take a look: [vidbg.js](https://github.com/blakewilson/vidbg)

### Built The Submission Workflow For The Unsent Project

I had a chance to work with [Rora Blue](https://www.instagram.com/rorablue/) on [The Unsent Project's new submission workflow](http://theunsentproject.com/submit). Read more about that [here](/unsent-project-boosting-conversions-4x-with-react/).

### Released Video Background Pro 4

Like vidbg.js 2, Video Background Pro 4 was also a complete overhaul using ES6+ JavaScript and too many new features and improvements to count. [Check out the full write up here](/video-background-pro-v4-released/).

### Created Rental Cash Flow App

This was a fun little project I decided to built to determine if a property is a good purchase or not for the purposes of renting it out for profit. The web app figures in costs like PMI, insurance, monthly mortgage payments, property taxes, rental vacancy and more. [You can check out the full write up here](/i-just-launched-my-rental-cash-flow-calculator-app/).

### Created Google Maps Directions Link Generator

This was a simple [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that I made in a night or two, but got a lot of [publicity on Product Hunt, reaching the 4th product of the day](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/google-maps-directions-link-generator). That was pretty exciting.

### Graduated From The University of Nevada, Reno

Four years in the making have finally paid off. I could not have done this without my friends and family. It feels great to have all of this extra free time to spend on projects and not have to worry about taking any more classes or tests.

### Created The Jres Specification

I wrote up this simple spec called [Jres](https://jres.dev) on how to format REST JSON API responses. It is helpful when creating frontend applications and knowing the format of the response when querying an API.

### Started Development Of A New Open Source Project

The month of December I've started development of a new open source project that I have been wanting to make for a while now. It doesn't have a name yet, but development is promising and I'm hoping to have a release out in the first quarter of the new year.

### 2020

2020 will definitely be a big year. Now that I'm out of school, there are a lot of possibilities to travel, learn new things, and capitalize on opportunities I couldn't have before.

I hope to travel a lot this year, and focus my energy on one single effort. In 2019, I built a lot of side projects, and while I had fun doing it, I feel like my time could have been better spent focusing all that time into one effort, whether that be a new project or business venture.

With all that being said, cheers to a new year, new decade, and new adventures!
