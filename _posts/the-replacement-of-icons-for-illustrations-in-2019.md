title: The Replacement of Icons for Illustrations in 2019

I have noticed a trend recently going on in web design where we are no longer using standard library icons like [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) to show off product features on landing pages, promo material, etc. Instead, I've noticed the rise of illustrations using a variety of pastel colors, dark borders, and uneven coloring outside the lines like a rushed art project in school that was done an hour before it was due.

Regardless, I personally like the idea. Where modern icons have perfectly formed corners, predictable shapes and colors, and are overall very generic, this trend is creating images that are unique.

I also find these illustrations more friendly and inviting opposed to the more "serious" standard icons seen on websites today. With that being said, there is still a time and a place for "serious" icons.

I decided to give a stab at making a few illustrations for [Push Labs, where I sell Video Background Pro.](https://pushlabs.co/video-background-pro)

These icons are meant to convey some of the perks of the plugin, like mobile autoplaying video backgrounds, Vimeo & YouTube video backgrounds, and dedicated support. I think they turned out alright for not being a designer.
