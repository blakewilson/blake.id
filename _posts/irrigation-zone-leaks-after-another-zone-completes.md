I was having an issue with an irrigation zone leaking after another zone completed. This leaking zone would continue to run until I manually started and stopped the zone.

No other zones were leaking, so I had a feeling it had to do with this zone's valve. Over time, these valve's diaphragms can crack and deteriorate. I know my irrigation system has [Hunter valves](https://www.hunterindustries.com/irrigation-product/valves/pgv), and thankfully they sell the valve [diaphragms at Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/1-in-PGV-Diaphragm-332100/203233584) so you don't have to replace the whole valve as long as there is no issues with the actual piping.

I started by turning off my water supply. I have a valve specifically to turn off water to the irrigation, so that's what I did. If you don't have something like this, turning water off at the main will work just as fine.

Next, I opened my valve box in my front lawn. Unfortunately it was a complete mess. There were two valves in this tiny 6in. valve box. The other valve is completely unaccessible. Thankfully I won't have to mess with it today and this'll be a project for another day:

I started chipping away at the soil inside the valve box with a handheld hoe, and then used a shop vac to suck up the soil/rocks/water/debris (Yes I relocated the slugs). It actually did a surprisingly awesome job.

On the top of these valves sits a solenoid which the irrigation controller sends electricity to to open/close the valve. Twisting these counter-clockwise will unscrew the solenoid. I did this to give me some working space:

These Hunter valves have 4 screws to get to the diaphragm. Every YouTube video I saw on these valves people use screwdrivers to remove the valve cover, but you can more efficiently use a 5/16 in. hex driver to take these off.

Once the screws are off, you'll be exposed to the [diaphragm](https://www.homedepot.com/p/1-in-PGV-Diaphragm-332100/203233584). Look at that ol' crusty thing:

You can easily pull it out with your fingers:

It's important no debris gets in the valve. Before putting the new diaphragm in, I turned the water supply back on briefly to flush out any debris that either was in the valve or had entered from disassembly. Be careful, doing this will gush water out of the valve entry while the water supply is on.

While I had the pieces out, I figured I should clean the valve cover as best I could. I did this in the sink with a screwdriver:

Now it's time to put everything back together with the new Diaphragm. I seated the new diaphragm on the valve **(be mindful of the orientation, there is a small piece of rubber at the top that seats onto the valve)**

Once the new diaphragm is in, secure the valve cover back on and thread the screws. I hand threaded the screws in a star pattern, making sure not to use a drill or impact driver since this is just plastic.

Once the screws were in, I reinstalled the solenoid:

And that's all she wrote! I turned on my irrigation zone and after the zone completed, there was no leaks coming from my other zone.

In terms of what caused all this, I think it is this: The zone only leaked after the other zone ran for an extended period of time (20 minutes). My guess is the old valve diaphragm wasn't sealing properly and after 20 minutes of the other zone running, caused a minor break in the seal of the valve which caused the leak. This would explain why starting and stopping the zone would allow the valve to properly reseal.

All in all this was a pretty easy project that took about 2 hours and less than $10 to accomplish.
