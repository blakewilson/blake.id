Yesterday I released my new [Rental Cash Flow Calculator Web App](https://rentalcashflow.app). This was a fun project that will generate a cash flow analysis and an amortization table for rental properties to determine if they are a good purchase or not.

This site was built using GatsbyJS, and uses the `gatsby-plugin-offline` plugin to transform the site into a Progressive Web App for devices that support PWAs.

You can [view the release on Product Hunt here](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/rental-cash-flow-calculator), or you can [view the site directly here](https://rentalcashflow.app).

Here are a few images below:
