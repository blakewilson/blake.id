<p>My backyard has gone through some changes these past couple of years. Most recently, a mix of soil, weeds, and some grass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":26,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4144-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This area was prone to creating a lot of mud when it rains. The drainage was pretty poor from a previous failed tilling attempt. Having a dog and mud don't mix very well, so I decided it was time to renovate this space with some sod.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I first started by mowing what grass and weed I had to the lowest setting my mower would go to. Then I put some flags up for each irrigation zone so I knew where they were.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next step was to till the entire space to bring up and loosen the soil:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":27,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4173-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-27"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tilled as close as I could to the irrigation heads, and then dug with a shovel to loosen up the soil nearest the heads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tiller I ended up renting from Home Depot was the Mid Tine Tiller from Honda. It worked great.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":28,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4157-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-28"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once everything was tilled and fresh, I raked as much as I could of the dead grass, rocks, or anything that would complicate laying down sod.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next up was establishing the grade. This was by far the most time consuming and back breaking work. As I mentioned before, I did a previous till which left the grade and level all out of whack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The grade of the soil is important for a few reasons:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Most importantly, you want a grade sloping down away from the foundation of the house so that water doesn't pool near the foundation</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Secondly, any pooling of water can kill grass or create mud</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, you want to establish what percent grade you need. This will vary by location, but I decided a 4% grade would work for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To determine this, you could setup a stake from one side of the yard to the other and determine the change in elevation every x feet, but I decided to do it a bit different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, I used a Carpenter's level and a formula to determine how much grade I need in inches over a given area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, say I want a 4% grade. A Carpenter's level is 4 ft., or 48 in. You can multiply 48 in. by the percent of grade (0.04):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>48*0.04 = 1.92 in</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means that the length of every Carpenter's level (4 ft), the ground should drop in elevation 1.92 in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":30,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-31-at-9.37.45-AM-1024x575.png" alt="" class="wp-image-30"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had no way to get any large equipment in my backyard, so all the work done on establishing the grade was done with a rake and shovel. It was a complete b**** to be honest. I tried my best to get a 4% grade, but it's not perfect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once I had a decent grade, I raked and leveled the soil as best I could. I ended up getting a pallet from Home Depot, and dragging it like a sled to get things evened out and flat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was all the prep work, now it was just waiting on the sod to arrive (it took an extra week because of the rain). I went with <a href="https://krturfgrass.com/product/palisades-zoysia/">Zoysia Palisades from King Ranch</a>. Zoysia is very good for foot traffic and pets, it also is pretty drought tolerant. From King Ranch's website:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"In fact, some studies have shown it to survive up to 15 weeks without water. Another crucial distinguishing point about Palisades Zoysia is that it can be mowed to as low as ½ inch in height. This aspect of the grass, along with its hardiness in dry conditions, makes it an ideal turf for golf course fairways and roughs – and, of course, for residential lawns."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>https://krturfgrass.com</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> My backyard was a total of 1100 sqft, which came out to 2 and 1/2 pallets of sod. King Ranch was able to deliver full pallets, but any halfs you had to pick up yourself. So I had the two whole pallets delivered while I rented a trailer from Home Depot and picked up the half pallet:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":31,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4385-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-31"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Now it was time to start laying the sod. I got about one row in and noticed how many trips I was taking back and forth in my wheel barrow. A lot of people talked online about using a <a href="https://gorillamade.com/product/gcg-7/">Gorilla Cart</a>, but I didn't think I needed it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":32,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4388-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-32"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also watered the sod after every couple of rows just to make sure it was staying fresh:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":33,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4390-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-33"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as I took more and more trips, I realized how little this wheel barrow could hold. I was counting only 7 pieces of sod each trip. So I decided to make a quick trip to Home Depot to test out the <a href="https://gorillamade.com/product/gcg-7/">Gorilla Cart</a>. It did not disappoint at all. I was able to get about 25 pieces of sod each trip now. If there is any tool that made this job a requirement it was this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":34,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4400-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-34"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":35,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4403-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-35"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After about 12 hours straight of laying sod (7am-7pm) I was finally done:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":36,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4415-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-36"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately the last batch of sod had some pretty rough edges, so I had to make do with what I had. The corners that didn't match up I filled with top soil for an even surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next day, I went over any imperfections with top soil and then prepped the roller that I rented from Home Depot. I only filled this roller about 1/4 of capacity to not damage the sod, I just wanted to make sure the sod was making good contact with the soil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":38,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4421-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-38"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upon completion of installing the sod, I watered it in for 40 minutes straight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, for the next two weeks, I'll be watering 3 times a day, for 20 minutes each. I'm following this chart for my watering protocol:</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's a final look at how it turned out:</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was having an issue with an irrigation zone leaking after another zone completed. This leaking zone would continue to run until I manually started and stopped the zone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No other zones were leaking, so I had a feeling it had to do with this zone's valve. Over time, these valve's diaphragms can crack and deteriorate. I know my irrigation system has <a href="https://www.hunterindustries.com/irrigation-product/valves/pgv">Hunter valves</a>, and thankfully they sell the valve <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/1-in-PGV-Diaphragm-332100/203233584">diaphragms at Home Depot</a> so you don't have to replace the whole valve as long as there is no issues with the actual piping.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started by turning off my water supply. I have a valve specifically to turn off water to the irrigation, so that's what I did. If you don't have something like this, turning water off at the main will work just as fine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":47,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_4530-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-47"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, I opened my valve box in my front lawn. Unfortunately it was a complete mess. There were two valves in this tiny 6in. valve box.   The other valve is completely unaccessible. Thankfully I won't have to mess with it today and this'll be a project for another day:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":12,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/388B4772-5373-40EF-A998-33D164B47343_1_105_c.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started chipping away at the soil inside the valve box with a handheld hoe, and then used a shop vac to suck up the soil/rocks/water/debris (Yes I relocated the slugs). It actually did a surprisingly awesome job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":16,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4508-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-16"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":15,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4509-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-15"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the top of these valves sits a solenoid which the irrigation controller sends electricity to to open/close the valve. Twisting these counter-clockwise will unscrew the solenoid. I did this to give me some working space:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":17,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4510-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-17"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These Hunter valves have 4 screws to get to the diaphragm. Every YouTube video I saw on these valves people use screwdrivers to remove the valve cover, but you can more efficiently use a 5/16 in. hex driver to take these off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the screws are off, you'll be exposed to the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/1-in-PGV-Diaphragm-332100/203233584">diaphragm</a>. Look at that ol' crusty thing:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":18,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4511-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-18"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can easily pull it out with your fingers:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":19,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4512-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-19"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important no debris gets in the valve. Before putting the new diaphragm in, I turned the water supply back on briefly to flush out any debris that either was in the valve or had entered from disassembly. Be careful, doing this will gush water out of the valve entry while the water supply is on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While I had the pieces out, I figured I should clean the valve cover as best I could. I did this in the sink with a screwdriver:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":20,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4516-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-20"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now it's time to put everything back together with the new Diaphragm. I seated the new diaphragm on the valve <strong>(be mindful of the orientation, there is a small piece of rubber at the top that seats onto the valve)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the new diaphragm is in, secure the valve cover back on and thread the screws. I hand threaded the screws in a star pattern, making sure not to use a drill or impact driver since this is just plastic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the screws were in, I reinstalled the solenoid:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":21,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4517-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-21"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that's all she wrote! I turned on my irrigation zone and after the zone completed, there was no leaks coming from my other zone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of what caused all this, I think it is this: The zone only leaked after the other zone ran for an extended period of time (20 minutes). My guess is the old valve diaphragm wasn't sealing properly and after 20 minutes of the other zone running, caused a minor break in the seal of the valve which caused the leak. This would explain why starting and stopping the zone would allow the valve to properly reseal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All in all this was a pretty easy project that took about 2 hours and less than $10 to accomplish.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Issue</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have a two story house with a 2-zone air conditioning system, one zone for downstairs, and one for upstairs. One day, it seemed impossible to cool the upstairs, and the downstairs was getting plenty of ventilation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After doing some research, these zones are controlled by something called a zone damper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":50,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/51RRvIaXq1L.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-50"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can see in the image above, the damper is a duct with a metal door that opens and closes, with a motor that sits on top to either open or close the damper. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These dampers have different default starting positions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Power open: By default, the damper is sprung closed, and when called for, the motor will power the damper open.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Power closed: By default, the damper is sprung open, and when called for, the motor will power the damper closed.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In most cases, the motor will fail and that is the only thing that will needed to be replaced. Unless there is physical damage to the damper/ductwork itself, there is no need to replace the damper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Diagnosis</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back to my case, the damper for the upstairs zone was power open, meaning, it was closed by default. I determined that the motor did fail, and needed to be replaced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I made this determination by first turning on the A/C for the upstairs zone, while turning off the A/C for the downstairs zone. In theory this should mean that the downstairs zone damper is closed and the upstairs zone damper is open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I confirmed the downstairs zone damper was closed, but the upstairs zone damper was closed too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I then turned on the A/C in the downstairs zone, and off in the upstairs zone. I confirmed the downstairs zone damper was open, and the upstairs zone damper was closed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So the upstairs zone damper was not properly opening when needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Replacing the Motor</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I turned off the power </strong>and went up in the attic and found the zone damper motor. You can find the zone damper motor by looking for a rectangular box on top of the ductwork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":51,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_3913-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-51"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I found that I had Honeywell M847D1004 damper motors. After doing some digging on Amazon, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0868C89Q7">I found a replacement by Valemo</a> for this model and bought two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the motors arrived, I got to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Replacing the motor is fairly straight forward. First you'll want to disconnect the power and ground wires.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once that is done you'll want to loosen the set screw. This set screw is somewhere underneath the motor, mine happened to be at the bottom. This set screw was for an Alan wrench, which made it easy to get to. You do not need to completely remove the set screw, just unscrew it enough to where you can pull the motor straight out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":52,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_3959-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-52"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see on the motor on the right, the black screw is the set screw referenced above. Additionally, you'll notice the metal bar sticking out. This fits into the damper housing and acts as a fixed point to ensure the damper itself doesn't rotate. Then you have the actual center piece of the motor which rotates the damper door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before sliding the new damper motor on the damper, ensure that the damper door is in the correct starting position:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>If your damper is power open, the starting position is <strong>closed</strong></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>If your damper is power closed, your starting position is <strong>open</strong></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the damper door is in the correct starting position, fit the new damper motor on, and tighten the set screw in the proper orientation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the new motor is installed, reconnect the power and ground wires.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":53,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_3916-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-53"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you can turn your power back on and test the diagnosis steps above. Except now, when calling for A/C in the zone with the motor you just replaced, you should see the damper door properly open/close now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Replacing the other zone motor</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since I bought two motors off Amazon just in case and I was already up in the sweaty attic, I decided I would replace the other zone motor as well. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately for me this motor wasn't as easy to get to. My attic is quite small with little to no walkways. I was practically a contortionist trying to get to this motor without putting any pressure on the attic floors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":54,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_3925-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-54"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On top of that, I had to move around some insulation as well. I swept and relocated the insulation, make sure to wear a mask for this, and let it settle for an hour or two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I then got some 2x4s and placed them on the joists by the motor so I could support myself while replacing the motor. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":55,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_3933-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-55"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, repeated the steps above. Once I got the new motor in, I replaced the insulation and cleaned up the space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":56,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_3957-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-56"/></figure>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lessons Learned</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few lessons learned from this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Try to optimizing the time of day/time of year you are doing this repair if possible. I got lucky doing this in April in Texas and even after only 20 minutes in the attic I was completely drenched in sweat.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>If you have little or no light in your attic get something like an <a href="https://www.olightstore.com/baton-3-pro-small-rechargeable-flashlight.html">OLight</a> with a clip and clip it to your hat. Either that or a headband light. Carrying your phone is not an option.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recently replaced by downstream oxygen sensor in my 01 Sequoia trying to resolve an exhaust issue. This didn't fix it, but I thought I'd document the process in case it's helpful for any else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First off, the Sequoia is a v8 engine with two exhaust manifolds, so you have two upstream O2 sensors, and two downstream O2 sensors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a diagram courtesy of <a href="https://www.toyotaguru.us/sequoia-2004-repair/heated-oxygen-sensor.html">Toyota Guru</a>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":61,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1865_1042_868-toyota-yaris-sensors.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-61"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bank 1 is the driver side, and bank 2 is the passenger side. I replaced the Bank 1 downstream O2 sensor, which you can see sits after the catalytic converter on the driver side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is what mine looked like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":62,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_4577-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-62"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see, my car has got some rust. The nuts that secure the O2 sensor and heat shield in place don't even look like nuts here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Start by unclipping the O2 sensor from the wiring harness, this will give you some more room to work as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, I used a nut extractor socket which helps get a grip on stripped or rusted nuts. Once I placed the socket on top of the nut, I hammered it down as much as I could to get a good seat on the nut:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":63,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_4590-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-63"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This technique ended up working pretty good, and I didn't even need to use a breaker bar to free these nuts. Just took a little bit of finesse to release the rust.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's a look at the O2 sensor and nuts once I got them released:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":64,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_4591-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-64"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And here is a look at the sensor entry point once I took the sensor off. Look at all that rust!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":65,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_4597-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-65"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I took a wire brush to it to clean up the threads:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":66,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_4601-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-66"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make sure to remove the old gasket as well! It may be caked on pretty good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you've got your area cleaned up, it's time to apply the new O2 sensor. I got mine off of Amazon, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H2CM92W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00">here is the exact one I used.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Start by adding the new gasket:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":67,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_4602-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-67"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then install your new sensor:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":68,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_4603-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-68"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since my old nuts were rusted and destroyed, I picked up some new ones from Home Depot. The new nuts I'm using were M8 with a 1.25 pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":69,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_4595-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-69"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hitting the sensor entry point with a wire brush really helped a lot. I was able to hand thread the nuts on afterwards:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide"><video controls src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hand-threading.mp4"></video></figure>
<!-- /wp:video -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, I reconnected the wiring harness. Here is a look at the finished result:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":70,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a scan tool with live data, you may also want to check to be sure that the O2 sensor is sending the proper voltage.</p>

<p>My 2001 Toyota Sequoia recently threw a P0505: Idle Air Control System DTC.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was able to quickly and easily fix this by cleaning the throttle body. This guide will detail how I did it on my Sequoia but in theory this could work for any other vehicle experiencing the same code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, you'll want to take the "V8 4.7L" guard plate off first. You can do this by removing the two 10mm nuts:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, remove the 10mm nut securing the hose line to the air intake:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, move the hose line out of the way and remove the guard plate:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_5318-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-77"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, loosen the hose clamp to the air intake filter box. This can be done with a Philips head or a 10mm socket:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":79,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_5319-1-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-79"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lastly, loosen the hose clamp attaching the air intake to the throttle body:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"wide","id":80,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img src="https://blakesworkshop.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_5320-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-80"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With these steps complete, you can pull the air intake <strong>away</strong> from the throttle body intake to expose the throttle body. You can rest the exposed air intake above the throttle body. <strong>Do not have your keys in the ignition or turn on the vehicle from this step forward.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can clearly see all the carbon buildup around the butterfly mechanism of the throttle body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To clean the throttle body, I'm using some <a href="https://www.oreillyauto.com/detail/c/o-reilly-chemicals/oil--chemicals---fluids/maintenance-chemicals/cleaners---solvents/carburetor-cleaner/4a5b19b886f5/o-reilly-chemicals-12-5-ounce-carburetor-and-choke-cleaner/orc2/72414/v/a/8206/automotive-suv-2001-toyota-sequoia?pos=0">Carb and Choke Cleaner I picked up at O'Reillys.</a></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You'll want to get a clean rag (microfiber preferably) and apply this throttle body cleaner. You want to clean the inner walls of the throttle body, as well as the points in which the butterfly mechanism sits closed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Be very careful with opening the throttle body butterfly mechanism manually.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some vehicles have an actual line that runs from the accelerator pedal to the throttle body, so when you put your foot on the pedal, the butterfly mechanism opens up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other vehicles are electronic and a motor opens the butterfly mechanism. If your car has a motor to open the butterfly mechanism, do so slowly with your finger, vs forcing it open quickly as this will generate electricity within the motor, which is not good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This video gives a great demonstration on the speed at which you should manually open your throttle body's butterfly mechanism:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

https://youtu.be/3B-a8WJtd8w?t=548
</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:embed -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you open the butterfly mechanism manually and slowly with your fingers, stick the rag inside and clean the points at which the butterfly mechanism typically sits closed. Make sure to clean the top and bottom!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>here's what she looks like after the cleaning:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you are satisfied with the clean, reverse the steps that you took to take things apart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be sure to check for any hose lines that may have become loose in the cleaning process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once everything is back together, clear the trouble codes and fire her up! you should see the P0505 trouble code go away.</p>
